htaccess-spam-blacklist-block
=============================

This file is created to collect and prevent referral spam traffic sources. 

Referral spam has been spread wide across the web. Add this to your .htaccess or config file on a Apache or Nginx server to prevent referral spam traffic from websites like semalt &amp; buttons-for-websites. This file is usually found in the root “public_html” folder of your website. 

NOTE:
This method doesn't stop the Analytics referral spam (because they are hitting Analytics directly and not even touching your website / server). You should also use filters in Analytics to prevent referral spam. 


## Other options for Google Analytics

If this method fails you can prevent referral spam by:
